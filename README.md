# Analog Guitar Pedals

The project includes electrical schematics, simulations in LTSpice, and a PCB design in Altium Designer.This project will feature four individual effects designs, followed by their physical implementation. This work is being carried out as part of my engineering thesis in Electronics at the Warsaw University of Technology.

## Project organisation

- _doc/_ - directory with documentation (currently empty)
- _DISTORTION_Boss-DS1/_ - directory with the schematic of the distortion effect
- _FUZZ_Face-Fuzz/_ - directory with the schematic, simulations, and PCB of the fuzz effect
- _ltspice-model/_ - directory with additional SPICE models and the components library
